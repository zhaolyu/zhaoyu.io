# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
# 
# Optimizations:
# - Polls CI status for push events (waits up to 5 minutes for CI to complete)
# - Builds directly (no artifact download needed, avoids permission issues)
# - Supports both workflow_run (preferred) and push (fallback) triggers
# - Concurrency group prevents duplicate deployments for the same branch
