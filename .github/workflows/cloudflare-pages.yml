# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
# 
# This workflow handles:
# - Production deployments on main branch merges
# - Manual deployments via workflow_dispatch
# 
# Note: PR preview deployments are handled by ci.yml workflow
# 
# Optimizations:
# - Builds directly (no artifact download needed, avoids permission issues)
# - Concurrency group prevents duplicate deployments for the same branch
# - Manual dispatch available for cases where CI was skipped (e.g., docs-only changes)
