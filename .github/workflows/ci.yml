# GitHub Actions workflow for CI checks on commits and pull requests
# 
# This workflow:
# - Triggers on push to all branches and pull requests
# - Runs type checking, linting, testing, and build verification in parallel
# - Ensures code quality before merging
# - Does NOT deploy (deployment is handled by cloudflare-pages.yml)
# 
# Optimizations:
# - Parallel job execution for faster feedback (~2-3 min vs ~4-5 min sequential)
# - All jobs include SvelteKit sync step for consistency
# - Build artifacts removed (deployment workflow builds directly)
# - Concurrency control prevents duplicate runs on rapid commits
# - Path-based filtering skips CI for docs/config-only changes
# - Draft PR skipping saves minutes until PR is ready for review
