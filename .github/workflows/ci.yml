# GitHub Actions workflow for CI checks on commits and pull requests
# 
# This workflow:
# - Triggers on push to main/develop branches and pull requests
# - Runs type checking, linting, testing, and build verification in parallel
# - Ensures code quality before merging
# - Uploads build artifacts for deployment workflow
# - Does NOT deploy (deployment is handled by cloudflare-pages.yml)
