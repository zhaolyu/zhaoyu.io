# Code Generation Workflow

**MANDATORY FINAL STEPS**: Complete these steps before marking any code task as done:

1. ✅ Review design principles
2. ✅ Write tests (if applicable)
3. ✅ **Run tests and verify they pass** - `npm run test`
4. ✅ **Run lint and fix all issues** - `npm run lint` (must pass with zero errors)
5. ✅ **Final verification** - Both test and lint must pass before completion

## Step 0: Review Design Principles

**CRITICAL**: Review code against design principles before finalizing.

### Core Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component does ONE thing well
- **DRY**: Check `src/lib/utils/` before writing new utilities - see [utilities.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/utilities.mdc)
- **KISS**: Simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI**: Build only what's needed now
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate data fetching, business logic, and UI
- **Theme Support**: All components MUST support both light and dark modes using CSS variables

## When to Write Tests

Write tests for:
- ✅ New components, utilities, stores
- ❌ Style files (CSS) - lint only
- ❌ Configuration files - lint only

## Final Steps Workflow

### Step 1: Review Design Principles

Review code against the principles above. Refactor if needed.

### Step 2: Write Tests (If Applicable)

1. Create test file co-located with source (e.g., `Component.test.ts`)
2. Follow [testing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing.mdc) guidelines
3. Aim for **≥90% coverage** (statements, branches, functions, lines)
4. See [TESTING.md](mdc:.cursor/docs/TESTING.md) for patterns

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
npm run test                      # Run all tests (MANDATORY)
npm run test -- path/to/file.test.ts  # Specific file
npm run test -- --coverage      # With coverage (≥90% required)
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ **All tests MUST pass** - CI will fail if tests fail
- ✅ Coverage ≥90% (if tests written)
- ✅ **No test failures allowed** - Fix any failing tests before proceeding

### Step 4: Run Lint

```bash
npm run lint      # Check for issues (MANDATORY)
npm run lint:fix  # Auto-fix issues
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ **Zero errors and warnings** - CI will fail if lint fails
- ✅ All code formatted correctly
- ✅ **Lint MUST pass** - Fix all linting issues before proceeding

### Step 5: Final Verification

**CRITICAL**: Before marking complete, you MUST verify:

1. ✅ **Run both commands and confirm they pass:**
   ```bash
   npm run test  # Must pass
   npm run lint  # Must pass with zero errors
   ```

2. ✅ Design principles applied
3. ✅ No code duplication (checked utilities first)
4. ✅ Theme support implemented (light & dark modes using CSS variables)
5. ✅ **All tests pass** (if applicable) - CI will fail otherwise
6. ✅ Coverage ≥90% (if tests written)
7. ✅ **Lint passes with zero errors/warnings** - CI will fail otherwise

**DO NOT mark code as complete until both `npm run test` and `npm run lint` pass successfully.**

## Quick Reference

**MANDATORY FINAL CHECKS** (run these before completing any task):

```bash
npm run test          # Run tests (MUST pass)
npm run lint          # Run lint (MUST pass with zero errors)
npm run test -- --coverage  # Check coverage (≥90% required)
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix lint issues
```

**Remember**: Both `npm run test` and `npm run lint` must pass before marking any code task as complete.
